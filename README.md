<details><summary> What are the features of these bots? </summary>
<br>
Currently automated bots hold 3 different subgroups under one umbrella.

You can check the features of each bot on the homepage and their own GitHub repository that I share and update regularly. 
</details>

<br>
Each bot has a free and paid version. The free version comes with an open-source license that you can change & modify. For paid ones, you need to purchase coins and those coins will be deducted whenever the bot successfully acts (applying for jobs successfully, listing companies successfully or swiping & sending messages successfully). You can check our shop for the prices of each product. 
</details>

<details><summary> Would i get banned or my account be blocked? </summary>
<br>
No, since you run the bot on your own device and the traffic is coming from your own address, the risks of getting banned from any of the websites we support is very low. This is because you run the bot on your own device, your traffic will be similar with your own actions and the bot will act humanely meaning it will perform stopping waiting and skipping actions randomly.Meanwhile we dont recommend applying more than 200 jobs per day via job apply bot.
</details>

<details><summary>I have an error while running the bot, how can i fix? </summary>

</details>

The free version comes with an open source license. You are free to modify and work in any way you want. Paid version comes with limited license meaning that you accept and approve that you will be using the bot for you only and you won't modify/sell/commercialize or steal in any way 
</details>

<br>
Yes. Linkedin pro has several features for unanswered or additional questions. Firstly, it can answer a question based on Linkedin‚Äôs default value from previous applications of yours.
